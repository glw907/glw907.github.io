      <description>I have to admit that the FOMO-factor in this declutter experiment is higher than expected. I was thinking that because I&amp;rsquo;d already suffered through the pain of leaving social media many months ago that I&amp;rsquo;d have an easier time with this.
A significant percentage of my FOMO anxiety relates to texts. Today I processed all my texts twice as planned &amp;hellip; once about mid-morning and again before I finished up with work.</description>

      <title>Digital Declutter Diary: Day 01</title>

      <description>One of the initial challenges of this experiment is getting folks comfortable with my new communication regime. The fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to stop (regularly) carrying a mobile phone outside of work hours has already caused some consternation at home. And my decision to maintain stricter separation between work and personal contact numbers and hours is prompting questions of &amp;ldquo;how do I know which number to use when I call or text you?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just about to embark on the &amp;ldquo;Digital Declutter&amp;rdquo; exercise detailed in Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World by Cal Newport. The process includes three steps:
Step one is putting aside a thirty-day period during which I will take a break from all optional technologies. That starts today!
Step two is exploring and reengaging in non-digital activities and behaviors that I find particularly satisfying and meaningful. I&amp;rsquo;m honestly pretty excited about this part of the exercise.</description>
